    <p>No Data Collection</p>

    <p>We do not collect, store, or process any personal data from users of the abcDeFi app. This includes, but is not limited to, personal information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, financial information, or any other identifiable data.</p>

    <h4>3. Permissions</h4>
    
    <p>Our app requests certain permissions to function properly on your device (e.g., internet access for decentralized finance services). However, granting these permissions does not result in the collection of any personal data or information. Permissions are solely used for the app’s functionality and are not used to gather or track user information.</p>
